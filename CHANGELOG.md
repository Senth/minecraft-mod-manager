## `1.4.1` - 2022-08-02: Fix modrinth bug

### Fixed

- Modrinth bug when searching for some mods [#196](https://github.com/Senth/minecraft-mod-manager/issues/196)
- Correct link to GitHub Project page [#191](https://github.com/Senth/minecraft-mod-manager/issues/191)

## `1.4.0` - 2022-06-14: Disabling CurseForge

### Removed

- CurseForge support, will be added again in v2.0. In the meantime, checkout [Ferium](https://github.com/gorilla-devs/ferium)
  for another minecraft mod manager.

## [1.3.0] - 2022-05-07: Installation Improvements

### Added

- Dependencies are now installed automatically ðŸŽ‰
- `--no-color` option to disable color output [#141](https://github.com/Senth/minecraft-mod-manager/issues/141)
- Runtime cache to save on requests to Curse/Modrinth APIs

### Changed

- `update` now skips downloading files if we already have the latest version [#139](https://github.com/Senth/minecraft-mod-manager/issues/139)
- Improved the searching algorithm where the search term `entityculling` would previously return 0 results [#56](https://github.com/Senth/minecraft-mod-manager/issues/56)
- Now uses tealprint library which will automatically disable color and unicode
  when trying to output Unicode characters [#141](https://github.com/Senth/minecraft-mod-manager/issues/141)

### Fixed

- Crash when loading forge mods if they contained inline comments [#146](https://github.com/Senth/minecraft-mod-manager/issues/146)
- Crash if a mod from Modrith was missing file links [#145](https://github.com/Senth/minecraft-mod-manager/issues/145)
- Colored output continued to next messages [#141](https://github.com/Senth/minecraft-mod-manager/issues/141)
- Handles Ctrl-C by stopping the program without printing a stack trace.
  It can still break the program in an invalid state [#140](https://github.com/Senth/minecraft-mod-manager/issues/140)
- Now retries to fetch/download file 5 times before skipping [#169](https://github.com/Senth/minecraft-mod-manager/issues/169)
- Now identifies installed mods correctly by slug as well [#149](https://github.com/Senth/minecraft-mod-manager/issues/149)
- Can now search by slug on Modrinth [#135](https://github.com/Senth/minecraft-mod-manager/issues/135).
  When searching on Modrinth include on their site modrinth.com/mods, searching by slug can return an empty result,
  so we now get the mod directly by slug.

- Doesn't save corrupt files that were downloaded, instead it keeps the old mod when updating [#150](https://github.com/Senth/minecraft-mod-manager/issues/150)

### Changes
