Install and update mods from ~~CurseForge~~ and Modrinth through a simple command.

## News â€” CurseForge support disabled (hopefully only for now) (2022-05-08)

Hi everyone!

I'm not sure if you're aware, Overwolf will tomorrow disable the old API for CurseForge which is used by mcman.

The old API that mcman used is sort of in a gray area legally.
But on a positive note, Overwolf has decided to open up the new API.
Albeit it comes with some limitations; not all mods can be downloaded from 3rd party apps.

I just applied for an API key for the new API, so hopefully it gets accepted.
For the mods that can't be downloaded I plan to link directly to the CurseForge page for easier manual download.

The Overwolf client has also become a lot better with more support, but still lacks official linux and OSX support.

As a server owner though, it requires a bit of changes to how you update the mods.
A tip is to sync your mods folder with Dropbox, that makes it a lot easier.

This will mean that CurseForge mods will be unavailable for some time.
The change in mcman will only take ~4 hours with updating tests.
The issue is keeping the API key safe.
I have some ideas but it will take time to develop and I also need to check with the
Overwolf team that it's legally possible.

Anyway, thanks for all the support!
Hopefully we can get mcman up and running again with CurseForge support ðŸ™‚

If it's not accepted, thank you for all the support so far!

Cheers,
Senth

## Full usage

```none
positional arguments:
  {install,update,configure,list}
                        Install, update, configure, or list mods
  mods
                        The mods to update or configure.
                        If no mods are specified during an update, all mods will be updated.
                        You can specify download sites and slugs for each mod (if necessary)
                           dynmap=curse
                           dynmap=curse:dynmapforge
                           dynmap=curse:dynmapforge,modrinth
                           dynmap=curse:dynmapforge,modrinth:dynmap

minecraft:
  -d DIR, --dir DIR     Location of the mods folder. By default it's the current directory
  -v MINECRAFT_VERSION, --minecraft-version MINECRAFT_VERSION
                        Only update mods to this Minecraft version. Example: -v 1.16.4
  --beta                Allow beta releases of mods
  --alpha               Allow alpha and beta releases of mods
  --mod-loader {fabric,forge}

                        this specific. The application figures out for itself which type
                        you'll likely want to install.
